# ALI-SMAD: MATLAB Space Mission Analysis and Design Tool  

ALI-SMAD is a MATLAB-based **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for space mission analysis and design, inspired by tools like GMAT and STK.  
The software enables satellite orbit modeling, maneuver planning, and mission design with intuitive visualization and integrated analysis.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Orbit propagation including J2, atmospheric drag, and solar radiation pressure  
- Maneuver planning (Hohmann transfer, inclination changes, custom burns)  
- Mission goals (e.g., achieving target SMA or inclination) with ΔV calculation  
- Ground station modeling, access time analysis, and pass time prediction  
- Orbit visualization and ground track plotting  
- Integration with **STK** for result validation and comparison

## 📊 Simulation Outputs  
The software provides multiple result plots and analysis options:  
- Variation of orbital elements (e.g., SMA, inclination) over time  
- Orbit trajectory visualization under perturbations (J2, drag, SRP)

## 🛰️ Maneuver Planning  
The GUI supports:  
- Manual maneuver design  
- Automated Hohmann transfer calculations  
- Analysis of maneuver impact on orbital elements

## 🎯 Mission Goals  
Users can define target orbital elements and the tool computes required ΔV to achieve them.  
Example: Achieving an inclination change with calculated ΔV.

## 📡 Ground Station Analysis  
Ground stations can be added with latitude, longitude, and altitude inputs.  
The software computes satellite pass times and access duration.
